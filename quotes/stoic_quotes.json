Even with paints all at the ready, no one can render a likeness until he has decided what he wants to paint. That\u2019s our mistake: everyone deliberates over the parts of life; no one over life as a whole. If you want to shoot an arrow, you must know what you are trying to hit: only then can you direct the point and steady the shaft. Our counsels are all astray in that they have no mark to aim at.
